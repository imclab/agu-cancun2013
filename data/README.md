The regional field has:

* inclination = -9.5 deg
* declination = -13 deg

The A2 and ME bodies have:

* Remanent magnetization:
    * inclination = -43 +- 5 deg
    * declination = -13 (from the 1973 field)
* Total magnetization (induced + remanent):
    * inclination = -40 deg
    * declination = -13 deg
* Magnetization = 6 A/m
