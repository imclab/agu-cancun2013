# Abstract

## Fast 3D magnetic inversion by planting anomalous densities

We present 
a 3D magnetic inversion algorithm
based on the 
gravity gradient inversion method
of "planting anomalous densities"
(Uieda and Barbosa, 2012a-b).

The algorithm consists
of an iterative growth
of the anomalous bodies
around prismatic elements 
called "seeds".

These seeds are user-specified
and have known magnetizations.

Thus, 
the seeds provide 
a way for the interpreter
to specify the desired skeleton
of the anomalous bodies.

The solution is dependent
on the adequate choice of seeds.


The inversion algorithm
is computationally efficient 
due to various optimizations
made possible by 
the iterative nature
of the growth process.

Therefore,
this method can used 
to test different hypothesis
about the geometry
and magnetization
of the anomalous bodies.
