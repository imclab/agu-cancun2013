for doing common tasks using Fatiando,
like generating synthetic data,
running inversions,
and plotting things.

.. tip:: You can download ``.py`` files of the recipes by clicking on the
    ``[source code]`` link bellow the recipe title.

.. tip:: On IPython_, try using the ``%load`` magic to load a recipe from the
    internet directly into your session::
